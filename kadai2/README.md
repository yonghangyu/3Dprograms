This is a program that implements the color coding of mesh based on Gauss-curvature and Vertex valence.
Before running program successfully,you should configure .sln with lib including openmesh and glfw.  
the example usage in console window like input 1 1 0 and you will get into the bunny mesh rendered in shading mode ,and input G or V ,
representing showing Gauss color coding and Vertex valence color coding respectively.
The below URL is the image for these two color coding of bunny mesh:
