this is a project that implements basic 3D object function including followings:
1.swith shading line point type by inputing 0 (no),1 (yes) in your console window 
2.input the object which you want to display from 1-5 (
tetrahegon,cube,octahehedron，dodecahedron，icosahedron) by inputing your chosen number in console window )
3.input whether you want to enable light on ?
4.then you will get display in glfw window 

for example : when you input as above like 1  1  1  then you choose tetrahegon to be displayed among shding line point three modes also in the light enviroment. Then in the glfw window you should input 1 2 3 respectively to display it in three modes.

before running program ,you should configure this .sln with glfw lib ,and this program is written in c++ using opengl .
