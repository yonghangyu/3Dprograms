This is a project that implements linear FEM-based elastomers of bunny mesh , this program is the modification based on program from 
https://github.com/mmmovania/opencloth

the modifications including :
1.change another mesh using bunny mesh 
2.changing glm lib into Eigen lib 

so this is a very classical program which helps you to understand FEM based simulation.

Before running it correctly ,you should install libs including Eigen, glm ,freeglut ,glew .
